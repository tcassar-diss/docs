- About the report...
- (diff between libOS and unikernel)
- Read the ComFuzz(?) paper

- Eval early good idea: drive project
- Apply flexos to a small library: 1wk
    - need to: create the boundary, identify the data that is shared
    - flexos limitations: 
        - flexos pre-compartmentalises application 
        - metrics for compartmentalisation: estimate 'security' of solution (even pre-compartmentalisation)

- Read intro, backgd, ..., ~~eval~~ for papers

- Security mem allocator: `snmalloc`

- Call with unikraft people: 
    - Priority item (e.g. not on security board) - call in 2 weeks or so

- Have a look at `virtiofs`

- Report: think about ~T-1month.
    - **Very** detailed outline (para by para) (cannot see the whole project arbitration wise)
